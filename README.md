# MALA_vs_EM
This repository hosts experiments estimating Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) parameters using Metropolis-Adjusted Langevin Algorithm (MALA) and Expectation-Maximization (EM). The project, undertaken as part of our Sampling Methods course, explores the efficiency and accuracy of these methods in parameter estimation. The code, contained in the /code directory, implements MALA and EM algorithms, while results are stored in the /results folder. For further details, refer to the accompanying report.
